ith the inverted index created, the query can now be resolved by jumping to the word id (via random access) in the inverted index.
In pre-computer times, concordances to important books were manually assembled.
These were effectively inverted indexes with a small amount of accompanying commentary that required a tremendous amount of effort to produce.
In bioinformatics, inverted indexes are very important in the sequence assembly of short fragments of sequenced DNA.
One way to find the source of a fragment is to search for it against a reference DNA sequence.
A small number of mismatches (due to differences between the sequenced DNA and reference DNA, or errors) can be accounted for by dividing the fragment into smaller fragmentsâ€”at least one subfragment is likely to match the reference DNA sequence.
The matching requires constructing an inverted index of all substrings of a certain length from the reference DNA sequence.
Since the human DNA contains more than 3 billion base pairs, and we need to store a DNA substring for every index and a 32-bit integer for index itself, the storage requirement for such an inverted index would probably be in the tens of gigabytes.
