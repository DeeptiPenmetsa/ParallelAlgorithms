The inverted index data structure is a central component of a typical search engine indexing algorithm.
A goal of a search engine implementation is to optimize the speed of the query: find the documents where word X occurs.
Once a forward index is developed, which stores lists of words per document, it is next inverted to develop an inverted index.
Querying the forward index would require sequential iteration through each document and to each word to verify a matching document.
The time, memory, and processing resources to perform such a query are not always technically realistic.
Instead of listing the words per document in the forward index, the inverted index data structure is developed which lists the documents per word.
